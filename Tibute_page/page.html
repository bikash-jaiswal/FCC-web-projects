            <h2>The brief histroy of King Prithivi Narayan Shah </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Borned on 7 January 1723, King Prithivi Narayan Shah was a son of King Nara Bhupal Shah and Queen Kausalyavati Devi of Kingdom of Gorkha.
                </li>
                <li>After the death of his father in 1743, Prithivi Narayan Shah ascended to the throne of Gorkha at the age of 20.</li>
                <li>He went to Varanasi to gain first-hand knowledge about the Political and Social condition of the Indian Sub-Continent</li>
                <li>Prithvi Narayan Shah is credited for starting the campaign for the unification of Nepal.</li>
                <li>Before his unification movement, there were total of 54 states in Nepal.</li>
                <li>For the unification movement, conquering Nuwakot was essential, as it lay between Kathmandu and the Gorkha District, making it a vital trading route to Tibet.</li>
                <li>After conquering the Nuwakot in 1744 CE, his next strategy was to conquer all the places around the Nepal valley, that is, Kathmandu and the neighboring regions. During this battle he was defeated and even lost his minister Kalu Pande.</li>
                <li>In 1765, Prithivi Narayan Shah attacked Kirtipur again after two humiliating defeats and finally conquered Kirtipur in his third attempt.</li>
                <li>King Prithvi Narayaṇ Shah was ultimately able to capture small principalities and annex them into Gorkha. This expansion was crucial as the British colonial forces had already begun colonizing the small kingdoms that form present-day India.
                    Shah was convinced that the British forces would eventually approach his kingdom. He believed that 50 small principalities would easily be conquered by the British as part of their colonization strategy. Expanding his kingdom made
                    it more difficult for British forces to make their move. His expansion campaign was very ambitious, especially as he was the king of a relatively small kingdom surrounded by strong and powerful neighbours.
                </li>
                <li>Prithvi Narayan Shah considered the state of Nepal as a ' Yam between two boulders ', referring to China on the North and the 'Emperor of Seas' to the South</li>
                <li>Towards the end of his life, Prithvi Narayan Shah was troubled by illness to a great extent. He had probably started to realize his end was near, which is why he decided to organize an unofficial council meeting known as bhardaari-sabha.</li>
                <li>This sabha continued for whole day for about 5/6 hours. Here, he talked about why was he involved in the unification of Nepal and what should the appropriate policies and programs for the future be regarding Nepal. The messages he gave
                    in this sabha was written down by his brothers and ministers and was compiled as Divya Upadesh.</li>
                <li>In January 1775, at the age of 52, Prithvi Narayan Shah died at Devighat, Nuwakot. Upon his death, his son, Pratap Singh Shah, succeeded him and his unification campaign was continued by his younger son, Bahadur Shah.</li>
            </ul>
